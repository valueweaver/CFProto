# CFProto
There is a need to create a no-fuss coldfusion framework where the implementation is left to the developer but framework gives a wireframe/prototype for creating a website using coldfusion. I have seen many frameworks but they are overbearing and unnecessary for creating a fully functional website for a user so I need everyone's help in creating a framework with zero learning curve. For using this framework the only things that developers should be aware of should be CFML :). Only thing to consider should be that a developer should know where to find which action file, query file, view file. Based on the action parameter in the url the view-controller.cfm should load the right file. For example if the url has action mysite.com/index.cfm?action=home. The view controller should load home page in the layout/default-layout.cfm file. If a user wants to add login functionality to the site then he should be able to add that functionality without any problem. All he has to do write a user login functionality add proper actions, view files and he should be done. I am not a CF guru and I have only created basic websites for my clients and I have always felt that for simple things we complicate things while implementing. So I need community's help in creating a framework that will get the job done in a weekend.
