# CFProto
There is a need to create a no-fuss coldfusion framework where the implementation is left to the developer but framework gives a wireframe/prototype for creating a website using coldfusion. I have seen many frameworks but they are overbearing and unnecessary for creating a fuly functional website for a user so I need everyones help in creating a framework with zero learning curve. For using this framework the only things that developers should be aware of should be CFML :)
